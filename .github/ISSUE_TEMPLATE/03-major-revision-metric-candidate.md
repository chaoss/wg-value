### Metric Items that Were Revised
<!-- Using a list, explain specific parts of the metric that you recommend should be revised. -->

### Checklist 
<!-- This checklist is used for revised metrics to ensure we follow CHAOSS quality standards and processes. Below checklist items don’t have to be completed all at once: create the metric release candidate issue first and then start working on the checklist. -->

#### Process
*MINOR CHANGES (e.g., copyediting, new image) DO NOT NEED TO BE REVIEWED BY THE COMMUNITY. If a metric is undergoing major changes (e.g., new objectives, new description), please use the following issue template. In both minor and major changes, it is assumed that a pull request has been created to suggest changes. If the metric is under a MAJOR REVISION, please address the following:*

- [ ] Update the [Metrics Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tAGzUiZ9jdORKCnoDQJkOU8tQsZDCZVjcWqXYOSAFmE/edit), if necessary, to indicate that the metric is under community review
- [ ] Add the metric revision to release notes issue in working group repo 
- [ ] "Metric Candidate Release" label added to the metric release candidate issue when fully ready fo release

#### Content Quality (check all that apply)

- [ ] Date of last review has been added to the revised metric at the bottom of the markdown file (month/year)
- [ ] Metric adheres to the current [metrics template](https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/templates/metric-template.md)

#### Technical Requirements for any Revisions

- Metric file name is the full metric name (and the name is the same everywhere) and only contains lower case letters and hyphens (“-”) for spaces
- Images are included using markdown and absolute path links (as described in the metrics template)
- Images have at least one empty line above and below them
- Images are placed in image folder and followed [naming convention](https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/templates/metric-template.md)
- There is no HTML code in the metrics markdown file
