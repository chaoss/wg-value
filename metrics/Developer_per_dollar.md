# {Developer per dollar}

Question: Would it be cheaper for a company to build software in house, or invest in open source software instead?

## Description
The most expensive thing about software is paying programmers to make the thing. If instead of hiring up to complete a project, a company could just invest in an ongoing open source project.

## Objectives
If an ongoing open source project has many contributors, then a business could invest less money than it would take to salary that many programmers and achieve equivalent results.

### Filters (optional)
