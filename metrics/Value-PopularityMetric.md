# Project Popularity & Living Wage
---

Question: How can we quantify the earnings potiential of a project, based on its popularity, that will signal the possibility of earning a living wage by contributing to the project?

## Description
---
One of the main issues with obtaining contributors or keeping them active on open source projects is the lack of funding. The old saying, "time is money" is very accurate. Nobody will continue contributing significant portions of their time without compensation, unless they have a real passion for the project(s). A developer being able to expand their skillset would make them more attractive to employers. If that skillset is at the forefront of some new process or technology, contributions to those projects could provide a living wage for many years to come.

## Objectives
---
The metric will give contributors a look at multiple project popularities that can highlight specific technologies or processes that would become useful to earn a living wage.

## Implementation
---
Project popularity will be determined based on a number of factors:  
* Number of contributors  
* Forks  
* Factors from BOSS Index  
	* Google score  
	* Job postings  
	* Aggregation of online discussion  

Using past successful projects as a baseline, differing weight values will be attributed to the factors of this metric to provide the most accurate portrait of project popularity.
