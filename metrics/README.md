## Metrics for Value Working Group

Groups within the CHAOSS project each have their own objectives in mind. In the Value working group, our aim is focus on measurements that result in better understand the impact that a project can have on individuals, organizations, communities, and society. 

## Intended audience 

All metrics are intended to be used by individuals looking to continue to understand how community work has an impact across a wide range of stakeholders. Stakeholders include people seeking funding for open source work, organizations seeking to understand the impact of the projects they support, communities hoping to understand how they support other community work, and communities hoping to understand how they are making the world a better place. 

## Metric guidelines

"Community work" is left open to self-selection. Some scenarios those working in Community could consider include: 

- Can I secure funding to start an event without focusing on lead generation? 
- Can I secure funding to sponsor or be sponsored as an event organizer?
- How do I quantify the value of me attending (one or more) conferences? 
- How do I justify to my executive sponsor to fund my community-oriented team?
- How did I receive funding from VCs for a community-oriented startup? 
- What is impact the projects that our organization supports? 
- How is our open source project helping improve the Internet as a social good? 

### Advice for useful metrics 

The intention is to show that metrics positioned as relative different values can be infinitely more effective than arguing “it’s the right thing to do for our Community.” With that in mind: 

- Is the metric interesting to my exective sponsor or boss's boss? If not, it's more likely aligned to [another working group](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics#goals-of-chaoss-metrics).
- Is the metric effective on its own (like a vanity metric) or as a comparison over time or both? 
- Is the metric most effective comparing to itself or to competitors? 
- Is the metric effective in a certain portion of an organizational chart in a corporation (Marketing, Product, Engineering, Human Resources)?
- Is the metric helping reveal why people may want to engage with a project from career perspective? 
- Is the metric helping determine how an open source project is improving the lives of people?
