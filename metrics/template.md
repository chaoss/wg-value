# Project Popularity 

Question: What is the popularity of a repository in a its metrics ecosystem. 

## 1.Description
Open source project economic value is hard to measure due to a lack of available usage or sales information. Project Popularity may provide a proxy to explore a projects value or importance.  

## 2. Objectives
In a quest to earn a living wage, workers may be interested in knowing which projects are growing and are underserved. The worker can use the Project Popularity metric to discover which repos are growing.

## 3. Formula

Base metrics include:
- number of contributors
- number of forks
- number of stars
- number of pull requests
- number of pull request comments
- number of issues
- number of issue comments
- number of downstream dependencies
- number of organizations contributing

## Implementation
Provide details on how to measure the metric, collect the data, and analyze it. The following sub-headings are optional but help to structure the different aspects of implementation.

### Filters (optional)
Include a Filter

### Visualizations (optional)
Include visualizations such as screenshot of the metric. There may be many more visualizations for this metric, we only want to provide a flavor for what this metric is about.

### Tools Providing the Metric (optional)
Metric must be currently deployed/available, in contrast to a tool having the "potential" to provide the metric. Provide direct link to implementation/documentation, if applicable

### Data Collection Strategies (Optional)
If there are several different ways to collect data for this metric, list them here. 
This may include expressing a metric in different ways.

## References
Blog posts, websites, academic papers, or books that mention the metric and provide more background.
