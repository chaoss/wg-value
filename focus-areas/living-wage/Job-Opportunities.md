Question: How many job postings request skills with technologies from a project?

## Description
A common way for open source contributors to earn a living wage is to be employed by a company or be a self employed or freelance developer. Skills in a specific project may improve a job applicantâ€™s prospects of getting a job. The most obvious indicator for demand related to a skill learned in a specific open source project is when that project or its technology is included in job postings.

## Formula
To obtain this metric on a job search platform (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed, or Dice), go to the job search and type in the name of the open source project. The number of returned job postings is the metric.

## Objectives
The metric gives contributors a sense of how much skills learned in a specific open source project are valued by companies.

## Sample Filter and Visualization
The metric can be extended by looking at:
* Salary ranges for jobs returned
* Level of seniority for jobs returned
* Availability of jobs like on-site or off-site
* Job location

The metric can be extended by searching not only for the name of an open source project but also related skills such as programming languages, processes, open source experience, or frameworks.

## Reference Implementation
