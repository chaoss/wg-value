**Question:** How many job postings request skills with technologies from a project?

## Overview
This metric measures the demand for skills related to an open source project, as seen through job postings requesting those skills. By tracking mentions of specific projects or technologies in job listings, contributors can gauge how skills learned in an open source project impact job prospects and the broader job market demand for that expertise.

This metric provides insight into how companies value skills associated with a project, which can inform contributors’ career development. It also highlights trends in the tech job market, helping individuals and organizations make informed decisions about skill development and project engagement.
