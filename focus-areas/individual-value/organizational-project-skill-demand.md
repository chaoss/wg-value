# Organizational Project Skill Demand

Question: How many organizations are using this project and could hire me if I become proficient?


### Overview
The Organization's Project Skill Demand metric is aimed at determining downstream demand of skills related to an open source project. This metric looks at organizations that deploy a project as part of an IT infrastructure, other open source projects with declared dependencies, and references to the project through social media, conference mentions, blog posts, and similar activities. Tracking this metric helps developers identify promising projects for career growth and contributes to project sustainability by indicating community engagement and potential for future development. While this metric doesn't directly address DEI issues, it can indirectly contribute by highlighting projects with diverse communities and inclusive practices.
