# Project Popularity

**Question:** How popular is an open source project?

## Overview
Project popularity measures the level of visibility and engagement around an open source project by tracking various data points, such as social media mentions, forks, stars, contributors, and downstream dependencies. These indicators reflect community interest and adoption rates, providing insights into a project's reach and potential impact.

Measuring project popularity helps inform project health and sustainability by identifying growth trends, which may indicate an increase in active use and contributions. A popular project is often seen as more valuable, both for individual contributors looking to work on impactful projects and for organizations considering where to invest resources. Popularity also helps reveal underserved projects with growth potential, which may present valuable opportunities for contributors and stakeholders.
