| Data Points | Description |
|---|---|
| Date of entry| Date data was imported to Social Listening tool|
| Date of comment| Date comment was made on original platform|
| Comment Text| Qualitative data brought in. Decide on how large you want these chunks ported. Some may port an entire email while others will be broken into one row per sentence. It should only have one “sentiment”|
| Data channel| Originating data channel the comment came from |
| Tags (created on codex document below) | Based on the unified codex of terms, decide what tags to track. There can be two kinds of tags. On the one hand, tags can be based on “themes” or recurring sentiment that people voice (e.g., gamer gate, flamewar, or thank you notes). On the other hand, tags based on “categories” can describe different aspects of a community that members comment on (e.g., events, release, or governance). |
| Social Currency Metric| The social currency being awarded or demerited in the system. This will directly affect numbers.|
| Weighted Score | Once you’ve decided what your “weight” will be, you can assign a system of -3 to +3 to provide a weighted view of human-tagged metrics (AI will not assign a weight for several reasons). This enables the “most impactful comment” filter.|
