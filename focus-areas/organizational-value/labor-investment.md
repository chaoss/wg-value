# Labor Investment

**Question:** What was the cost of an organization for its employees to create the counted contributions (e.g., commits, issues, and pull requests)?

## Overview
Labor Investment tracks the monetary commitment organizations make in supporting open source projects through employee contributions. This metric assesses the labor costs incurred by organizations, providing transparency in the financial commitment tied to open source engagement.

Measuring labor investment informs organizational health and sustainability by highlighting the level of resources committed to open source projects. For Open Source Program Office (OSPO) managers, this metric offers insights into prioritizing resources, justifying budgets, and understanding the return on investment (ROI) across a portfolio of projects. For example, the Labor Investment metric can be used to prioritize investment or determine return on investment such as:

  * Labor Investment as a means of evaluating OSPO priorities and justifying budgets
  * Labor Investment as a way to explain product/program management priority
  * Labor Investment as an argument for the value of continued investing in OSPOs
  * Labor Investment to report and compare labor costs of contributed vs in-house work
  * Labor Investment to compare project effectiveness across a portfolio of projects

### Data Collection Strategies
- **Quantitative Data:**
  - Count contributions by type (e.g., commits, issues, pull requests).
  - Break down contributions by contributor types (internal vs. external).
  - Track the average hours spent per contribution type and multiply by hourly labor rates to calculate total labor costs.

- **Calculation:**  
  Labor Investment = For each contribution type, sum (Number of contributions * Average labor hours per contribution * Average hourly rate).

### Filters
- **Contributor Types:** Filter by internal vs. external contributors to understand organizational versus community labor.
- **Contribution Types:** Focus on specific contribution types like commits, issues, or pull requests.
- **Project Source:** Differentiate between internal, open-source, or competitor open-source repositories.

### Visualizations
