# Organizational Influence

**Question: How much influence does an organization have on an open source community?**

## Overview

Organizational Influence measures the influence that an organization has on an open source community. An organization may influence the direction and development trajectory of a project, signaling some level of control within a community. This metric can also help open source maintainers track and measure organizational influence to add legitimacy to their projects and monitor the level of control by [individual organizations](https://chaoss.community/metric-organizational-diversity/).
An organization's influence may also serve as a signal of how easy or difficult it may be for new [contributors](https://chaoss.community/metric-contributors/) to contribute to an open-source project. It can also help an open-source advocate in an organization justify continued funding and support for engagement.
