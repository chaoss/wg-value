## Problem Statement 

Community initiatives do not reflect the same direct monetary value as other common organizational efforts. This results in community work often being undervalued by organizations. (As one contributor puts it, how do you communicate [the business value of hugs](https://medium.com/@mbbroberg/the-value-of-community-metrics-4945dc752d42)?) 

Due to this difficulty in comparison, it is essential that we **share metrics that have proven success** in securing funding for community work.

## Mission

Value group will collect all known metrics that, when measured, help secure funding for community work. These metrics must be, at furthest, one step removed from a direct financial incentive to invest.

### Known limitations

The approach used to date (March 2020) uses language that defaults to the technology industry and its organizational structures. These terms may not reflect other industries or organizations (e.g. nonprofits). 

While our measurements may focus on certain categories to begin (enterprise technology, open source software), our aim is to become the de facto standard for all value-based discussions around community work. Please bring up terminology discrepencies or recommendations through [a new issue](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues).

### History 

The Value group is part of the [CHAOSS project](https://chaoss.community/), which is a project under the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

The Value group was relaunched in March 2020. See the [./metrics/CHANGELOG.md] for details.

## Contributing

All contributors are welcome to participate in Value group. Regular participants have the opportunity to join as a [Core Contributor](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value#core-contributor). 

### Propose a metric

This groups welcomes any metric that is, at most, one step removed from funding community programs, whether it's in the shape of an Open Source Program Office (OSPO), Developer Relations (DevRel), influencer program (ex. Microsoft MVP), or other specific goal. Read more about our goal of metrics here.

If you have a metric in mind that **directly links community activity to organizational funding**, then:

- Copy the [`metric-template.md` file](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/blob/master/resources/metrics-template.md)
- Open a pull request with the new metric added to the `metrics` folder
- Continue the discussion in the pull request until we decide to merge it

If you are not sure the metric is a good fit, it's best to start by discussing through a [new issue](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues).
