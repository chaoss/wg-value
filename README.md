## Introduction

### Scope

A well-designed Open Source Program Office (OSPO), when present, is the center of competency for an organization’s open source operations and structure. As described in the [OSPO deep dive research report](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/a-deep-dive-into-open-source-program-offices), OSPOs benefit organizations worldwide by:

* Implementing unique and flexible sets of tools that support OSS development models while meeting corporate Information Technology guidelines
* Overseeing the establishment or adaptation of internal policies to better manage open source software (OSS) compliance in fast-moving, dynamic environments
* Helping to bridge the cultural gap between traditional software development practices and the requirements of open source development
* Improving technical mentorship, and compliance-related education and training programming for team members across all levels of the organization

> These strategic open source centers can take many shapes. For instance, depending on the size of the organization, its structure can vary from a virtual OSPO with one FTE to a large dedicated team. To learn more, please take a look at the different [structures](https://8112310.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8112310/LF%20Research/LFR_LFAID_Deep_Dive_Open_Source_Program_Offices_081922.pdf), [roles](https://8112310.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8112310/LF%20Research/LFR_LFAID_Deep_Dive_Open_Source_Program_Offices_081922.pdf), and [responsibilities](https://8112310.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8112310/LF%20Research/LFR_LFAID_Deep_Dive_Open_Source_Program_Offices_081922.pdf) an organization can choose when builging an OSPO.

### Problem

Tracking performance metrics is one of the [key responsibilities of many OSPOs](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/): [OSPOs might use specialized tools](https://todogroup.org/guides/management-tools/) to track their organization’s contributions to open source projects, analyze the type of contributions from their organization, identify contribution patterns, and provide recommendations to improve the development impact

### Goals

Community initiatives do not reflect the same value as organizational efforts. The OSPO Metrics working group aims to advance how organizations understand the value that open source projects can provide as well as the value of these programs / initiatives.

Main objectives include:

* Define useful metrics
* Ease implementation with CHAOSS tooling
* Set up best practices and metrics standards for OSPOs


### Purpose

OSPO Metrics group will develop metrics that, when measured, help make the impact of community work more transparent. It will also help drive the adoption of metrics, implementation of best practices, and tools to adopt community health metrics standards, which OSPO practitioners can engage and contribute.

### Who should join this working group?

## Metrics

## Metrics Focus Areas

We are compiling dimensions of value that can be used in the following areas of analysis:

| Focus Area | Goal |
| --- | --- |
|[Social Value](focus-areas/social-value/) | Identify the degree to which a project is attentive to improving the lives of people beyond software.|
|[Organizational Value](focus-areas/organizational-value/) | Identify the degree to which a project is monetarily valuable from an organization's perspective.|
|[Individual Value](focus-areas/individual-value/) | Identify the degree to which a project is valuable to me as an individual user or contributor.|
|[Communal Value](focus-areas/communal-value/) | Identify the degree to which a project is valuable to its community of users (including downstream projects) or contributors.|
|[Academic Value](focus-areas/academic-value/) | Identify the degree to which a project is valuable to researchers and academic institutions.|
