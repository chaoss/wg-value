# CHAOSS Value Metrics Group (VMG)

## Read our Launch Plan

VMG is a new group focused on metrics for Economic Value in open source.

Economic value is expressed in different ways for different types of
stakeholders.  We will be exploring this space in the coming months.

See our [launch plan][1] for more info.

## Background

### Problem Statement

We have gotten requests from community members to establish industry-standard
metrics for economic value in open source.  Lack of metrics makes it difficult
for business decision makers to compare open-source methods to alternatives.
Lack of metrics makes it difficult to allocate resources optimally across
projects, slowing decision making and product innovation.

### Opportunity

We believe that value metrics can accelerate the adoption of open source
methods within industry, providing more opportunities for developers to make a
living wage in open source.

### Goal

Between March 2019 and September 2019 we will execute a launch plan with
limited goals:

Identify Stakeholders and Validate Interest
- Identify market segments and stakeholders
- Understand Who cares about Open Source Value (and why)
- Specify and prioritize Key Performance Indicators
- Calculate potential aggregate economic value

Grow hands-on community
- CHAOSS Members: Consultants, researchers, grant writers
- Project Stakeholders: Sponsors, maintainers, contributors, consumers

Build reusable assets
- Repeatable methodology for discovering value
- MVP Tooling with Development Roadmap

In the long term, we’d like to publish trusted industry-standard Value Metrics.
A kind of S&P for software development, an authoritative source for metrics
significance and industry norms.  

## Focus Areas

| Focus Area | Goal |

| 3. Downstream Value | Estimate the value provided to other open source projects. |
| 4. Ecosystem Value | Estimating the value of an open source project’s ecosystem. |
| 5. [Living Wage](./focus-areas/living-wage) | Expanding opportunities for people to make a living wage in open source. |
