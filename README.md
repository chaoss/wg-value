## Problem Statement 

Community initiatives do not reflect the same value as other common organizational efforts. This results in community work often being undervalued by people, organizations, communities, and society. The Value working group aims to advance how we understand the value that projects can provide. 

## Mission

Value group will develop metrics that, when measured, help make the impact of community work more transparent. 

### Known limitations

The approach used around value often defaults to the technology industry and its organizational structures. These approaches may not reflect other industries or organizations (e.g., nonprofits). 

While our measurements may focus on certain categories, our aim is to become a standard for all value-based discussions around community work. Please bring up terminology discrepencies or recommendations through [a new issue](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues).

### History 

The Value group is part of the [CHAOSS project](https://chaoss.community/), which is a project under the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

## Metrics Focus Areas

We are compiling dimensions of value that can be used in the following areas of analysis:

| Focus Area | Goal |
| --- | --- |
|[Social Value](focus-areas/social-value/) | Identify the degree to which a project is attentive to improving the lives of people beyond software.|
|[Organizational Value](focus-areas/organizational-value/) | Identify the degree to which a project is monetarily valuable from an organization's perspective.|
|[Individual Value](focus-areas/individual-value/) | Identify the degree to which a project is valuable to me as an individual user or contributor.|
|[Communal Value](focus-areas/communal-value/) | Identify the degree to which a project is valuable to its community of users (including downstream projects) or contributors.|

Each focus area lists a collection of relevant questions. If you are interested in answering a question for your community, go to the associated resource page where we collect strategies for answering the question.

## Contributing

All contributors are welcome to participate in the Value working group. Regular participants have the opportunity to join as a [Core Contributor](#core-contributors). 

### Propose a metric

This groups welcomes any metric that provide insight into the value that an open source project can provide to individuals, organizations, communities, and society. Specific examples include the value of a project for an Open Source Program Office (OSPO), Developer Relations (DevRel), Influencer Programs (e.g., Microsoft MVP), job security, and global accessibility. 

If you have a metric in mind that **directly links community activity to individual, organizational, communal, or societal impact**, then:

- Copy the [`metric-template.md` file](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/blob/master/resources/metrics-template.md)
- Open a pull request with the new metric added to the `metrics` folder
- Continue the discussion in the pull request until we decide to merge it

If you are not sure the metric is a good fit, it's best to start by discussing through a [new issue](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues).
