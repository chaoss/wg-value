## Introduction

### Goals

Community work is often undervalued. Whether this is recognizing the value of people's contributions, the value that a community generates from their work, or how an organization derives value from the communities they rely on. The Value working group aims to advance how we understand the value associated with open source projects. 

### Purpose

The Value WG develops metrics that, when measured, help make the value found in open source project more evident. 

### Who should join this working group?

All contributors are welcome to [participate](#participate) in the Value WG. The areas of interest include  organizational value, individual value, communal value, and academic value.
